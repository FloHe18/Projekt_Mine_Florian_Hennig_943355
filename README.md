## About
This is the repository for the ARR Pirates Level Design Project of the SoSe2021 course on game and level design at the University of Applied Science Mainz. 

## Teams and Decisions 
More information can be found on the Miro board: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lDZC1nE=/

## Contribute 
All four teams can contribute to the project. 
To avoid merge conflicts, please only update your teams scene at a time!

* If you use variations or own creations for your level design blockouts, save the created files (e.g. with ProBuilder) at `Assets/Art/TeamNAME/`.
* If you create prefabs of your own creations or versions of existing prefabs, save those in your teams folder located at `Assets/Art/TeamNAME/`.

## Git Routine
* Pull before you start working on the project!
* Commit your changes.
* Pull again, to see if nothing else as changed.
* Push your changes to the remote (origin).

## Merge Conflicts
If Merge Conflicts happen, these need to be resolved, check which files are conflicted, you can resolve merge conflicts. 
BUT either your changes or the other parties changes will be overwritten! 
If you have talked to the other party involved, and overwritting the changes are ok/possibile, do it.
IF NOT notify Linda on **Mattermost**.
